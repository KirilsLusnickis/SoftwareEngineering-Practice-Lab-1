SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL TESTING

Lab lessons Instruction
The task is to write a testing program. The testing program must execute the following:
To run a program to be tested (testable program).The testable program can be any program in any PL, as long as it corresponds to the examined testing method. (For example if we use the method of condition testing it means that in program there should be conditions EX. If there is loop testing, it means that in program there should have a loop(s) to test.)
To take the set of input data for the testable program from a file.
To write down the real results of the testable program into a file.
To have a file with expected results from the testable program.
To have the comparison result of the really obtained data with the set of the expected results written down in a separate file or represented on the screen.
Note: create the files with the set of input data and expected results by yourself, taking into account all necessary values for complete verification of the testable program on all possible routes, depending on the examined testing method.
A report must contain:
The given task.
Source code of the testing program.
Source code of the testable program.
Screenshots of the testing program showing the testing results.
Depending on the testing method all necessary steps of solution.
In conclusions to represent advantages and disadvantages of the applied testing method.
Note: The defense of all lab works must be done during laboratory lessons.
